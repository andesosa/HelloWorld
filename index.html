<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p> I chose this class because I've always wanted to learn how websites work. They seem so simple from the outside, yet in reality they are so complex. I love technology and I want to learn as much as I can about it. Many of my friends have taken this course before, and they loved it. That is another reason why I'm encouraged to take this course.</p>
